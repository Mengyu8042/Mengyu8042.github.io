Hi! I'm Mengyu Li. I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China (RUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Cheng Meng](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/sztd/c8798bd759634ad984964a646fb8c25d.htm) in 2025. From November 2023 to May 2024, I was an exchange student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Professor [Xiaodan Fan](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xfan/). I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020. 

My research mainly focuses on developing efficient methods for large-scale optimal transport problems and statistical models. I am also interested in the applications of statistics and machine learning in solving significant scientific problems.
