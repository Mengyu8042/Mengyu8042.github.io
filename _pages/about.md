My name is Mengyu Li. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Institue of Statistics and Big Data](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China (RUC), under the supervision of [Assistant Professor Cheng Meng](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/sztd/c8798bd759634ad984964a646fb8c25d.htm). I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020. 

My research mainly focuses on developing efficient methods for large-scale optimal transport problems and statistical models. I am also interested in the applications of statistics and machine learning in solving significant scientific problems.
