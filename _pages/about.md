Hi! I'm Mengyu Li. I'm now a postdoctoral fellow at Tsinghua University (THU) advised by Prof. [Jun S. Liu](https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China (RUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Cheng Meng](https://cheng-bdal.github.io/) in 2025. From November 2023 to May 2024, I was an exchange student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong advised by Prof. [Xiaodan Fan](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xfan/). I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020. 

My research mainly focuses on developing efficient methods for large-scale optimal transport problems and statistical models. I am also interested in the applications of statistics and machine learning in solving significant scientific problems.
